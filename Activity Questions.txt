Merge Conflict Explanation
	The merge conflict in this scenario resulted from two different branches modifying the same line in a file, so Git was unable to determine which altered line to merge into the main branch. This merge conflict resulted from the two merges from branches A and B, which both changed line two, resulting in a situation where Git was unable to determine which version of line two from A and B to choose from.

Merge Conflict Resolution 
	This merge conflict was resolved by choosing which changed line should be merged into main, which was done by the notepad text editor, or could be done via an IDE for code. Once I chose the version of line two and resolved the conflict, merging into main was successful and line two from A was not included, replaced by line two from B.
